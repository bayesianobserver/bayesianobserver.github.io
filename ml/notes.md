<p class="message">
Machine learning is a rapidly expanding field, with several organically contributing subdomains. This document is meant to keep track of interesting high level ideas in these fields. The notes and links here are woefully incomplete and are mostly meant to be placeholders for me to come back to and to maintain useful references.
