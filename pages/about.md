**About me**

In the past, I've worked as a research scientist developing macihne learning methods for network security (2010-2014), as a machine learning quant at a quantitative headge fund (2014-2022), and as a research engineer working on adaptations of large language models to large amounts of textual news data (2022-). 

**About this blog**

I have a strong interest in economics and technology. This blog is a collection of posts and ideas born out of that interest.
