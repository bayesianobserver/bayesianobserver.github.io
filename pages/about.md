**About me**

I am a researcher and engineer with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (BTech, MS, PhD). For the last 10 years I've had a strong interest at the intersection of economics, financial markets and AI. I currently work as a quant researcher in the financial markets in New York, focused on utilizing machine learning methods to predict idiosyncratic returns of stocks. In the past, I worked as a research scientist developing macihne learning methods for network security (2010-2014), as a machine learning quant at a quantitative headge fund (2014-2022), and as a research engineer working on adaptations of large language models to large amounts of textual news data (2022-2024). 

**About this blog**

I have a strong interest in economics and technology. This blog is a collection of posts and ideas born out of that interest.
