**About me**

I am a researcher and engineer with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (BTech, MS, PhD). I've worked as a research scientist in network security, using statistical machine learning methods to identify anomalies in internet traffic, as a machine learning quant at a quantitative headge fund, and as a research engineer working on adaptations of large language models to large amounts of textual news data. 

**About this blog**

I have a strong interest in economics and technology. This blog is a collection of posts and ideas born out of that interest.
