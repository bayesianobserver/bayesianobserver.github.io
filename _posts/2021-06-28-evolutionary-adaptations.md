I have a pet theory that we humans are bad at anything that deviates sharply from what we evolved for. This is widely accepted when it comes to a number of physical aspects of our existence, documented below. This is a working document in which I will continually add evidence in support of this theory. 

**Sleeping at night**: we evolved to have a circadian clock. Worked who work at night shifts and sleep during the day have an increased risk of cancer, all else being equal. 

**Sleeping on hard surfaces**: 

**Diet**: A natural diet consisting of naturally occuring plant based foods, nuts and meats is best for the human body. Grains are a relatively recent invention, as is milk, and therefore both don't sit quite well with the body for many people (celiac disease, lactose intolerance). COnsuming foods with substaces that were not easily avaiable 10,000 years ago is probably not the healthiest - this includes sugar.
