I have a pet theory that we humans are bad at anything that deviates sharply from what we evolved for. This is widely accepted when it comes to a number of physical aspects of our existence, documented below. This is a working document in which I will continually add evidence in support of this theory. 

**Sleeping at night**: we evolved to have a circadian clock. Worked who work at night shifts and sleep during the day have [an increased risk of cancer](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/napping/), all else being equal. 

**Sleeping on hard surfaces**: I haven't found published research on this, but I imagine we are adapted to sleep on hard surfaces, or at least not very soft matresses. And so I believe sleeping on very soft matresses could lead to health problems in the long term. 

**Diet**: A natural diet consisting of naturally occuring plant based foods, nuts and meats is best for the human body. Grains are a relatively recent invention, as is milk, and therefore both don't sit quite well with the body for many people (celiac disease, lactose intolerance). Consuming foods with substaces that were not easily avaiable 10,000 years ago is probably not the healthiest - this includes sugar. 

**Physical Activity**:  Evolution favored a physically active lifestyle necessary for hunting and gathering, whereas today's lifestyles are predominantly sedentary.
Consequences: Increased prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and musculoskeletal problems.
Mitigation: Incorporate regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, or structured exercise routines, into daily life.

**Sunlight**:  Humans evolved under direct sunlight, which is necessary for vitamin D synthesis, but modern indoor living reduces exposure.
Consequences: Vitamin D deficiency can lead to bone disorders, and possibly affect mood and immune function.
Mitigation: Spend more time outdoors in natural light and consider vitamin D supplementation if needed.

**Sleep Patterns**: The natural light-dark cycle guided our sleep patterns, but artificial lighting and screen exposure disrupt these rhythms.
Consequences: Poor sleep quality and duration can lead to cognitive decline, mood disorders, and other health issues.
Mitigation: Practice good sleep hygiene by reducing screen time before bed, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and creating a conducive sleep environment.

**Social Structures**: Humans evolved in closely-knit tribal societies with constant social interaction, contrasted by todayâ€™s often isolated urban living.
Consequences: Increased rates of loneliness and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety.
Mitigation: Foster a strong social network through community involvement, regular social activities, and the use of technology to stay connected.

**Child Rearing**:  Traditionally, child-rearing was a communal activity, but modern norms often leave parents isolated with the task.
Consequences: Increased stress and difficulty in parenting, potential impacts on child development.
Mitigation: Seek and offer communal and familial support, engage in parenting groups, and share caregiving responsibilities where possible.

**Noise Pollution**: Evolution did not prepare humans for constant exposure to loud and artificial noises of urban environments.
Consequences: Hearing loss, increased stress levels, and disrupted sleep.
Mitigation: Use ear protection in noisy environments, choose quieter routes and living areas, and promote noise regulations.

**Information Overload**: Our brains evolved to process information vital for survival, not the constant stream from digital sources.
Consequences: Cognitive overload, reduced attention spans, and heightened stress.
Mitigation: Limit screen time, prioritize important information, and practice mindfulness or meditation to improve mental focus.

**Hygiene Hypothesis**: Modern cleanliness practices reduce our exposure to the microbes that help develop our immune system.
Consequences: Increased prevalence of allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases.
Mitigation: Balance cleanliness with exposure to natural environments, consider probiotics, and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.

**Pace of Life**: Rapid pace of modern life versus a more gradual pace of change in evolutionary history.
Consequences: Chronic stress, burnout, and lifestyle diseases like hypertension.
Mitigation: Incorporate regular breaks, stress management techniques like yoga or meditation, and prioritize work-life balance.
