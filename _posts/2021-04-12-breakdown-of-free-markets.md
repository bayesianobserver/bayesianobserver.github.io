A 'free market' is an idealized mechnism wherein buyers and sellers come together to buy a sell a good or service, with little or no external control or regulation. For example, if you want to buy a cup of coffee in the United States, you, the buyer can simply go buy it at any seller, pay whatever a given coffee shop is charging, assuming you like the cost, and buy a cup of coffee. The price of a cup of coffee is not set by the government. On the other hand, the market for purchasing petrol/gasoline for your automobile in India is not a free market because the price per liter is set by the goverment of India.  

In this post, I am going to collect instances of market failures, where a free market was set up but the outcomes are very different from those inteded byt he free makrket framework. 

1. Hospitals in rural areas
2. Tacit duopoly in the US dialasis industry
