I believe obtaining and acting upon feedback from others is a crucial part of growth. Startups obtain feedback from their market, academics obtain feedback from conferences and journeals they publish their work in, restaurants get feedback in the form of restaurant critics and just plain foot traffic, and so on. However, in the world of ideas, there are a few places where feedback is prevented, because of a closed system. By 'closed systems' I mean collections of individuals in which the flow of information is deliberately restricted. Some examples are: 

- Conservative and traditional families: often do not like to put up their ideas and rituals up for open demcratic debate. As a result, its possible to continue practices that are actually completely anachronistic, or even down right harmful.

- Religious cults: by definition require adherance form their members, without questioning. 

- Military research: too sensitive to publish or discuss with researchers in adacemia or industry. Military research can easily be very backward, simply because it does not get the scrutiny that academic researchers get from their peers or industry practitioners get from the market. 

In each of these systems, the flow of information is deliberately restricted. I'd think spending too much time in any such closed system can be dangerous to one's growth.
