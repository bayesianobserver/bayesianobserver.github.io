Getting feedback from others is a crucial part
By 'closed systems' I mean collections of individuals in which the flow of information is restricted. Some examples are: 

- Conservative families

- Religious institutions, cults

- Military research

- Financial research 

In each of these systems, the flow of information is deliberately restricted. In military and finance, researchers forgo the privilege to freely talk about their research with the outside world, because of the sensitive nature of their work. This naturally restricts the feedback they can get on their work. 
In religious cults, and in ultra-conservative families, the organizations are closed by design.
