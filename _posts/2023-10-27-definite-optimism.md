In his book Zero To One, Peter Thiel introduces vocabulary that helped click an idea for me. For several years Ive been trying to trying to express the idea of the difference between two different types of people. The closest I came to expressing this difference was enterpreneurs versus non-enterpreneurs, but the difference is more subtle. 

* People who decide to do something they want to do. I know several such people, aand they are mostly enterpreneurs. For example, a friend of my wife left her job at Goldman Sachs about 10 years ago to go to Bombay and start a OTT media company. 

* People who work in more conventional jobs, earlning a salary, and reskilling and moving to a differnet job when their existing field becomes overcrowded or automated. 

The difference between the two types of people is only _manifest_ as enterpreneur versus employee, but at a fundamental level, it is described by Thiel's characterization of 'Definite' versus 'Indefinite'. The Indefinite person (or company , society, etc.) believe that the future is random and not so much in theor control, and therefore they hedge their bets by doing multiple different things, acquiring many skills and degrees. The Definite person has a concrete idea about the future and does that one thing that makes him/her very good at it, and continues to chip away at creating that future. 

In Thiel's calculation, the US was a Definite society in the 1950s and 60s, but since the 1980s it has been an Indefinite society, characterized by the prestigious but indefinite professions of lawyers, consultants and finance professionals - none of which are definite in nature. Becoming a Definite person requires greater clarity about the way the world works because it requires predicting what is important and will not be redundant. It also requires courage, because working towards a Definite future requires working much harder - one does not have a hedge.
