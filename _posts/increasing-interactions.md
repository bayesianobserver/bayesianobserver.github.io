In the technology world, there is a lot more scope for inter-disciplinary work and discoveries. I feel this is held back by too few interactions between people from different fields. Sure, it represents a cost -- time spent interacting with people outside your field can be time wasted if it doesn't yield anything useful. But such is the nature of the explore-epxloit tradeoff. I feel we as socities do not do a good job of 'mixing' enough.
