I've often found myself understanding people's coreer trajectories by looking at Linkedin. If someone is head of AI in a biotech startup, what did they do immediately before that? What and where did they study? How many years of experience do they have? 

In the age of LLMs, I think LinkedIn could make some interesting tools for people (maybe they already exist in the paid version of LinkedIn?): 

- Be able to answer queries like the above, not for a single profile, but in aggregate. For example: 
  - In the pharma industry, how many years do scientists without a PhD take on average to be promoted to Principal Scientist? 
  - What is the average tenure of people at company X? 
  - What are the most commmon destination industries for people who graduated from the MBA program at School X? 
  - When people leave consulting, what kinds of jobs do they go to?
