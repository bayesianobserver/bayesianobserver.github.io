I feel modern curriculum for children lack education in basic concepts of economics – these basic ideas as so basic that we need not wait till college to teach them formally – I’m talking about things like: 

- what are prices and how do they arise, Why is something expensive or cheap?

- ‘cooperation vs competition’, 

- the basic idea of a prisoner’s dilemma, 

- tragedy of the commons, 

- iterated vs one-time games, 

- what is a strategy, 

- what are ‘incentives’, 

- how should one reason about the incentives of a party in any given situation, etc. 

- basic principles of psychology: what is the other party thinking? How am I feeling and why?

I feel these topics can be introduced to kds as young as 8-9 years, via a carefully curated material that is practical and engaging. I intend to pursue this, starting small in 2024.
