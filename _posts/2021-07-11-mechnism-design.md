Two things that I would really like to see: 

- **Estimation of policy interventions**: Realistic methods for running simlulations for evluating the effects of real world policy interventions, so that it can be tested with confidence whether an intervention wil have the desired effect, whether there will be unintended consequences, etc. 

- **The inverse problem**: A computational framework for designing the details of a policy intervention that would meet the desired goals.
