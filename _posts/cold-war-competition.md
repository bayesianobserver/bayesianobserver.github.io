For all its negative connotations (proxy wars, bloodshed, etc.), the cold war between the US and the USSR was a period of technological competition. A new cold war is supposedly brewing between the US and China, or perhaps is already well under way. This makes me think about competition between corporations -- monopolistic corporations are not incentivized to innovate. They become sloppy and risk-averse, protective of the status quo. The US has seen this play out repeatedly over the last 100 years in several fields. So, part of me is excited about the technological competition that the US-China cold war is/will bring with it. As long as the two can remain locked in competition without any physical wars, it might be a good thing for humanity overall.
